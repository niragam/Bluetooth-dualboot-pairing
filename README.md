# Dual-Boot Bluetooth Headphone Auto-Connect (Windows + Linux)

This guide walks you through setting up Bluetooth headphones so they automatically connect in both Windows and Linux with high-quality audio, without needing to re-pair on each reboot.

This guide will **synchronize the trust and key info** between systems and optionally **force A2DP (high-quality audio)** without fallback to HSP/HFP (low-quality mic mode).

Tested on:
- **Windows 11 24H2**
- **Linux Mint 22.1**
